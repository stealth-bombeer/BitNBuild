## A secure & efficient solution for Product Counterfeiting
Product counterfeiting poses a major challenge, with fake and unauthorized replicas of genuine products being manufactured and sold at lower prices and with substandard quality. This issue impacts a wide range of products, including electronics, pharmaceuticals, and footwear.To combat this problem, we have created a comprehensive solution that allows manufacturers (such as Dell, boAt, Cipla, and others) to register on our platform and generate unique digital QR Codes for their products. These QR Codes serve as a means to verify and authenticate each product, ensuring its genuineness.
However, QR Codes alone can be vulnerable to forgery. A legitimate QR Code can be copied and placed on counterfeit products. To counter this, our solution employs a dual QR Code system. Each product is assigned two QR Codes: one public and one private.

Public QR Code: This code is visible on the surface of the product and can be scanned by anyone to verify the product's authenticity.

Private QR Code: This code is concealed within the product's packaging and is only accessible once the product is purchased. Scanning the private QR Code confirms that the product has been purchased and prevents it from being reused or copied.

By using both QR Codes, our system ensures that even if someone duplicates the public QR Code, the product's authenticity remains secure due to the unique private QR Code.

## Challenges with Existing Systems
- Product Counterfeiting: The prevalence of counterfeit goods undermines consumer trust and harms brand reputation.
- Cumbersome Management of Physical Documents: Handling and maintaining physical guarantee and warranty cards is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
- Misrepresentation of Refurbished Products: Refurbished items are sometimes sold as new, especially when defected products are returned.
  
## Our Solution

- Use of blockchain to maintain integrity and for authentication.
- Use of IPFS storage to store all the documents digitally on a decentralized network.
- Automation of the verification system using QR code.
- Tracking the products using dynamic NFTs.
- Biconomy for gasless transactions.
